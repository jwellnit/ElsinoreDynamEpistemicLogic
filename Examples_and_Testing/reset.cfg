Types:
Players = jill, bob, sam
Values = a, b, c, d
Bool = true, false

Properties:
valid :: Values -> Bool ()

Actions:
learnFact(p: Players, v: Values) {
  public (p) valid(v) = true
}

Initial:
valid(a) = true()

looks like (jill, bob, sam): Initial

Execute:
print: model
learnFact(jill, b)
learnFact(bob, c)
learnFact(sam, d)
print: model
looks like (bob, sam): Initial
print: model
learnFact(jill, d)
learnFact(bob, b)
learnFact(sam, c)
print: model
looks like (bob, sam): Initial
print: model
Done.
